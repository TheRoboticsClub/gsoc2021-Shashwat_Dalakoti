Welcome to the official blog for my GSoC'2021 project under JdeRobot.
I am working for the project `Exercise using Deep Learning for Visual Detectoin` under my mentors [David Pascual](https://github.com/dpascualhe) and [Pankhuri Vanjani](https://github.com/pankhurivanjani).
The project aims at adding new Computer Vision Exercises to the Robotics Academy under the new paradigm of uploading DL models directly via the web template. <br/>
