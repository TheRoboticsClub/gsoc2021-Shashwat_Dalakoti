Welcome to the official blog for my GSoC'2021 project under JdeRobot.
I am working for the project `Exercise using Deep Learning for Visual Detectoin` under my mentors [David Pascual]() and [Pankhuri Vanjani]().
The project aims at adding new Computer Vision Exercises to the Robotics Academy under the new paradigm of uploading DL models directly via the web template.
