* **Resolved issue of process thread closing when launching different modes one after another** - There was this strange issue occurring during the docker execution of the exercise. The process thread of the respective mode would sometimes close straight after starting. This usually happened when different modes were launched one after another. This was strange as the above problem didn't occur during the non docker execution. Analyzing more made me realise that the issue was arising whenever the frequency thread from the previous mode execution was still on and the process thread of the new mode was started. I wasn't sure what to do. Based on the above analysis, I intuitively made 2 changes in the backend and somehow the issue was solved :) The changes were as follows:
    * Always starting the process thread before the frequency thread.
    * Closing the frequency thread whenever the process thread closes.

* **Resolved benchmarking issue occurring during the docker launch via start.sh**

* **Resolved model visualizer connectivity issue occurring during the docker launch**
